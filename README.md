## üåü Why Web Accessibility Matters

Web accessibility ensures that websites and web applications are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. According to the World Health Organization, over a billion people worldwide live with some form of disability. Implementing accessibility best practices benefits:

- People with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive disabilities
- Elderly users with changing abilities
- Users with temporary disabilities (e.g., broken arm)
- Users with situational limitations (e.g., bright sunlight, noisy environments)

Beyond inclusion, web accessibility often:

- Improves SEO performance
- Reduces legal risks
- Enhances overall user experience for everyone

## üîß Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
# OpenAI API for AI recommendations
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Email configuration for reports
AWS_SES_SMTP_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
AWS_SES_SMTP_HOST=your-smtp-server.com
AWS_SES_SMTP_PORT=465
AWS_SES_SMTP_USER=your_smtp_username

You can also run a simplified version of the tool from the command line:

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the prompts to enter a URL for analysis. This will display basic results in the terminal and show a visualization if you have a graphical environment.

## üîç Accessibility Criteria

Web4All checks websites against these key accessibility categories:

| Category      | Weight | Description                       | Tests Performed                       |
| ------------- | ------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Images**    | 15%    | Checks images for proper alt text | Alt text presence and quality         |
| **Headings**  | 15%    | Analyzes heading structure        | H1 usage, heading hierarchy           |
| **Links**     | 10%    | Evaluates link text quality       | Descriptive links, skip links         |
| **Forms**     | 15%    | Reviews form accessibility        | Form labels, form error handling      |
| **Structure** | 20%    | Examines semantic HTML structure  | Semantic elements, landmarks          |
| **Contrast**  | 15%    | Basic color contrast assessment   | Text-background contrast ratio        |
| **Keyboard**  | 10%    | Evaluates keyboard accessibility  | Focus indicators, keyboard navigation |

The tool assigns a weighted score to each category and calculates an overall accessibility score on a scale of 0-100.
